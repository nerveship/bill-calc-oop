# bill-calc-oop
A newer version of an old project, using some OOP stuff I've been reading about. 

##Usage
Download the .exe under releases and open the program. 

The program will ask for various prompts and perform calculations, ending with a screen letting you know your bill total, savings and leftover cash.
